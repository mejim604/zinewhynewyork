<h1>Immigrant Dancers in New York City: <br>
    Why are they Still Here?</h1>

<hr = width="500 em">

<h6><i>By: Maria Luisa Mejia, Gabriella Fernandez and Emily Hoodenpyle.</i></h6>


<p> After finishing her professional degree in English Studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, Linh An saw an opportunity to move to New York City when her parents who work as diplomats, were asked to move there. Her goal was, and still is, to pursue a professional career in dance in both Musical Theater and Street Styles. She entered the New York dance scene with hopes to further develop her artistry and technique. Back in Hanoi, she never received any formal training and the professional opportunitites in her home country cannot compare to the ones in New York City, the artistic mecca of the world. <br>
    An, is just one of the many immigrant dancers that have chosen to come to New York City to pursue dance. According to The US Department of Homeland Security, from the 83K immigrant dancers that move to the United States in one year, 40% of them end up in New York City. In fact, the demand is so high that the Dance/NYC Alliance has foundd 205 dance organizations with programs to help immigrant dancers settle and with their professional endeavours.  <br>
    Although these opportunities do exist, building a successful career in New York City as a dancer can become quite difficult when you are an “alien” in the country and therefore are not allowed to work. In order to be hired legally for any jobs, dancers need to acquire an “O -1 Artist Visa”, which according to the US Citizen and Immigration Services website, is created for“aliens” who possess “extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics (...) and have been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements.” <br>
    Unfortunately, getting the O -1 Visa is not only a very lengthy and complicated process, but also an expensive one,  due to the high fees that lawyers who specialize on getting the visa charge. <br>
    Furthermore, to simply audition for some jobs in this field it is required that you are part of certain unions that are geared towards the art workforce in the country, and don’t make it easy for artists from other parts of the world to enter. For example in the case of musical theater, ‘Equity’ requires its members to have a proof of residence. Also, SAG AFTRA, for Films and Television, requires a social security number. Dancers need more than just talent, when it comes to them building their professional careers in the city of their dreams. <br>
    Not being able to be hired is not only unconvenient for them financially, but also makes them feel as if they are always one step behind in the professional scene. Liza De La Garza, a 22 year old Mexican dancer attending Pace University for Arts and Entertainment management, feels that when she taks dance classes, U.S. born dancers are always in the lead. Dance classes in the city tend to be somewhat of a competition because the teachers are usually top - tier choreographers. Therefore, it is not uncommon that those attending the classes are being scouted for the teacher’s next project. This means that dancers in New York City tend to give 110% of their effort and performance in every class. <br>
    But even if a choreographer sees Garza in class and wants to hire her, she wouldn’t be able to take the offer.“Sometimes I have to turn down work”, Liza says “because I don’t have a social security number, and don’t have the permit to work.” She says it feels like always starting at the bottom of the list, because of circumstances that outweight her talent.<br>
    Students may want to work professionally as a dancers in New York City, but are simply not allowed to do so yet. Their unfit visa status puts a strain on their careers.  The longer it takes for them to get an Artist Visa, the longer it takes for them to get their careers started and get valuable work experience.<br>
    These circumstances are unfortunate because choreographers in New York do want to work with Immigrant Dancers. Rose Lu, is a dancer who moved to New York City from Taichung, Taiwan six years ago to pursue a professional career in dance and filmmaking.  Through her experience she has realized that people actually approach her because she is an immigrant. She explains that looking Asian is an advantage for her because people are always curious about the different look so they like to ask her questions, which is a good conversation starter and way to make connections. <br>
    Similarly,  Elodie Dufroux, a contemporary dancer from France who extended her originally 6 month stay in New York City to 5 years (and counting), says that because she is an immigrant, people love her accent and think she is special. “They love that you’re not from here.” <br>
    Choreographers do want diversity in their groups and dancers from all over the world have lots of talent. But even though people are interested in hiring international dancers, most times they simply can’t.<br>
    Because of this, getting the O - 1 Artist visa seems to be the ultimate goal for dancers coming from all around the globe. Nonetheless, this permit is still not the answer to all of their problems. <br>
    Carlos Neto, is a Portuguese dancer, actor and choreographer who moved to New York City from London, where he started his professional career, about 6 years ago. He got the O -1 visa before moving to the city in order to perform in a play Off - Broadway for a few months, but after getting an offer to teach regularly at the commercial dance sudio, Broadway Dance Center, he decided to stay. <br>
  Like Dufroux, Neto realized through the years that in both theater and dance “You cannot do all jobs, even with an Artist Visa.”<br>
    Also, getting an 0-1 visa will land you right into the “alien of extraordinary ability in a specific field” box, which means you will only be able to make use of that very specific label. This means that with an O -1 Dance visa you are not allowed to try your extraordinary abilities in different areas, even if it is still related to the arts, narrowing down their professional opportunities and leaving no room for experimentation and variety. <br>
    After landing in New York City, International Dancers also have to work their way through this fairly expensive city and find ways to support themselves considering that they may not be allowed to work. Commonly, if dancers don’t come into the city right away with a work permit,  they most likely have at least at some point financial support from their parents.<br>
     Taking into consideration the testimonies from our conversations, it seems that dancers who come to New York City without at least one of these two financial assistances, go through an extremely hard time finding ways to support themselves, including risking their immigration status by accepting jobs that pay in cash to be able to do it “under the table”.<br>
    So, why are these dancers coming to New York? “[we are] not allowed to do anything” says Lihn An, so why do they come at all? Turns out, it is the community and supportive atmosphere  that has been built through the years in the New York dance scene what makes staying, and fighting for it, worth it. <br>
    Neto, for example, calls the dance scene in New York City “healthy” and explains that “people have less of [the feeling of a] dance community anywhere else in the world because their industries are much smaller.”New york is also where all the elders and ‘OG’ dancers are. It has has seen so much of the hustle of making dance a respected carrier and so many dance styles have emerged from it, that no other community can compare to it. <br>
    Contemporary-Indian dancer Brinda Guha, works to make the New York dance scene accessible for dancers from all over the world. A few years ago, Guha was the head of the International Visa Program at Broadway Dance Center, a program targeted to dancers over the age of 18 from all over the world who can come and train with some of the best teachers in the world. <br>
    Her mission was to “get dancers all over the world under one roof,” yet she was aware that the financial aspect was a stop sign for many, considering that the program did not offer a work permit, so dancers couldn’t plan to come to the city to train and earn money at the same time, it something they have to invest in. Because of this, Guha aims to “create a curriculum that makes it worth it.” <br>
    Guha is the daughter of two Indian immigrants and pioneer of the dance style she calls “Contemporary Indian Dance”. Her family owns a studio in New Jersey where they train dancers in this particular style.  She believes she would not have been half as succesfull as she has been if she was not based in New York City. “[New York] has a speed, a hustle, maybe because it’s expensive. New York has a standard that weeds out people, people here focus on what’s working.” <br>
    Similarly to Lu and Dufroux, she has never felt discriminated in the dance community for looking different, on the contrary, she feels it is celebrated. “In New York, no one looks twice at an immigrant, I don’t have to prove my identity to anyone.” <br>
    Dancers choose New York City because it is where they can get the best training, since it is the home and birthplace of many dance styles that have found their way though the globe. <br>
    The only thing stopping them from succeeding is the fact that they are not allowed to work and the system they are caught in doesn’t make it easy for them to get past this obstacle. Yet these dancers are doing whatever it takes to stay because in their eyes, they cannot get what they are getting in New York City anywhere else. <br>
    It is a city where everyone is willing to work hard for what they want, and that energy lingers in the dance studios. The passion is felt through the hallways and the determination of those who have to work harder to stay moves the community forward and further.<br>
